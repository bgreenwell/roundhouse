# roundhouse 0.0.1.9000

* Fix URL typo in `DESCRIPTION`.

* New `sound` and `sound_repeat` arguments to `random_fact()` for determining whether or not the phrase "Chuck Norris" should be shouted, and how many times, before generating a random fact. You can also delay the sound a certain number
of seconds using the `sound_delay` argument.

* New function `punch()` which works just like `kick()` (but without the `type` argument).


# roundhouse 0.0.1

* Initial release.
